In order to create the diagnostic plots in 'analysis/lookup_galaxy_classify_and_diagnostic_plotting.py', you'll need to install Galfit and source extractor. Both of these are necessary in order to classify new galaxies that aren't included in the classification tables already.

##How to install and run Galfit:
Go <a href="https://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/peng/work/galfit/galfit.html">here</a> and install the binary that is appropriate for your system.

Test that it is working by typing:

'/Users/rnevin/Applications/galfit' on the command line, make sure you are giving the proper path to where your galfit is installed.

##How to install Source Extractor:
Go <a href="https://sextractor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installing.html">here</a> and run through the directions to install and test source extractor.

In order to run images through source extractor, it requires a variety of default files, which I provide in this folder.
